# InkOS Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the current focus areas for InkOS development. Timelines and priorities may shift as we gather feedback and refine the product vision.

## Phase 0 — Scaffold Stabilization
- Harden the Tauri v2 scaffold and ensure cross-platform builds.
- Establish continuous integration for Rust and frontend code.
- Document project architecture and contribution workflows.

## Phase 1 — Core Experience
- Implement core note-taking features backed by the Rust engine.
- Ship the initial onboarding flow and workspace creation.
- Add local data persistence with syncing abstractions.

## Phase 2 — Collaboration & Sync
- Introduce multi-device synchronization support.
- Implement collaborative editing and presence indicators.
- Add permission management and workspace sharing controls.

## Phase 3 — Extensions & Ecosystem
- Provide plugin APIs for community-driven extensions.
- Publish design system documentation and reusable component library.
- Explore marketplace and distribution strategy for extensions.

## Phase 4 — Production Hardening
- Performance profiling and optimization across Rust core and UI.
- Security audits, telemetry opt-ins, and privacy safeguards.
- Comprehensive QA, accessibility audits, and release management playbooks.
